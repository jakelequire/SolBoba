This project uses the following libraries:

To install these dependencies, run the following command in the terminal:

## Usage

The source code for this project is organized into three main folders: `components`, `styles`, and `pages`.

- The `components` folder holds all of the React Components for the webpages.
- The `pages` folder contains the source files for each webpage.
- The `styles` folder contains the CSS for the project.
